AOTOOLS reduces IR images from adaptive optics. It uses effective dithering, either sky subtraction or dark-subtration, and flat-fielding techniques to determine the effect of the instrument on an image of an object. It also performs bad pixel masking, degrades an AO on-axis PSF due to effects of anisoplanicity, and corrects an AO on-axis PSF due to effects of seeing.

Download and unzip the tarfile "aotools."  These are IRAF script language codes, which provide the associated command-line menus and helpfiles, etc. The author, however, provides no guarantee of their operability on various modern platforms running IRAF.
