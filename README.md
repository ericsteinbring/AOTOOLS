AOTOOLS reduces IR images from adaptive optics. It uses effective dithering, either sky subtraction or dark-subtration, and flat-fielding techniques to determine the effect of the instrument on an image of an object. It also performs bad pixel masking, degrades an AO on-axis PSF due to effects of anisoplanicity, and corrects an AO on-axis PSF due to effects of seeing.

Download and unzip the tarfile "aotools."  These are IRAF script language codes, with associated menus and helpfiles, etc. The author provides no guarantee of their operability on platforms running IRAF.
